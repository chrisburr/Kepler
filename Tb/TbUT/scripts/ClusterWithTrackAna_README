This is a simple script to loop over a TB run that has ben processed by TbUT and has tracks added to the ntuple.
To run interactively:

< 

In you home area, create your own work area:
> mkdir TBANAL/
> cd TBANAL
>   mkdir Output
>   mkdir Plots/

Set up ROOT environment (ROOT 5!) - code is not fully compliant with ROOT 6.
>
//> setenv CMTCONFIG x86_64-slc5-gcc46-opt



LbLogin -c x86_64-slc6-gcc48-opt
> SetupProject LHCb v36r2
> root [0] .x runClusterWithTrackAna.C


* Right now, it is set up to run over a file in the area:
  const TString m_fileIndir = "/afs/cern.ch/work/s/sblusk/public/TB/";
and it picks up the file in subdirectory: "BoardA6/", set with:
  const TString m_board   = "A6";

* Only the files defined in ClusterWithTrackAna.h will run, so if you grab a different
file, you need to check it is a good run and in the list of files. As of April 21, 2016,
only the fgood 2015 test beam runs are included.


[*] A set of plot should pop up after the script runs, and an output ROOT file called histOutput.root is created.

[*] Until we have a more refinced processing scheme, files that you want to test should be put in by hand into 
ClusterWithTrackAna::getFileBase (follow the examples in there).

[*] Input & output files directories are included in the Analysis_Inputs.h

Once we have to process many runs, we should have a way of automatically providing the input file and the output file.
This is being worked on...


KNOWN ISSUES
------------

* Array stripGap[4] need to be updated to depend on the particular sensor. Right now, it's assumed no gaps for Type A, and same gaps for all type D.
